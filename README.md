# heroc

The heroc is programming language, a subset of the GNU C language. It was created by doc. RNDr. Vilém Vychodil, Ph.D. (http://vychodil.inf.upol.cz/) at Department of computer science of Palacký university (http://inf.upol.cz) to be used in the __Compilers 1__ course. 

The components
 - [x] lexical analyzator
 - [x] syntactic analyzator
 - [x] semantic analyzator
 - [x] stackode generator
 - [ ] gas generator
 
 Also implemented various tools:
  - [x] ast (basic) displayer
  - [x] ast exporter to scheme, it's evaluator/interpreter (deprecated, absolutelly not working)
  - [x] stackode exporter to scheme, it's evaluator/interpreter (yeah, really!)
  - [x] scripts for various batch testing
  
  Take a look at various examples (`examples/*.herocio`) to see how it works and what does my implementation support.
